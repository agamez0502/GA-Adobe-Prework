# 🎨✨ Adobe Digital Academy Apprenticeship – Prework Projects

Welcome to my Adobe Prework portfolio!  
This repository contains all the hands-on projects I completed for the **Adobe Digital Academy Apprenticeship Program**.

Each module included two assignments:  
- ⭐ A guided **example project**  
- 🚀 My **own custom version**, where I applied creativity, styling, layout improvements, and personal flair  

These projects helped build my foundation in **HTML, CSS, responsive design, and light JavaScript**, while developing UI/UX instincts and independent problem-solving skills.

## 📘 About This Prework
The Adobe Digital Academy Prework is designed to introduce applicants to the fundamentals of front-end web development.  
Throughout these four modules, I completed hands-on exercises that tested my skills in:

- HTML page structure
- CSS styling and responsive layouts
- UI/UX design principles
- Basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation
- Recreating example designs and improving them creatively

These projects helped me strengthen both my technical ability and independence as a developer.
