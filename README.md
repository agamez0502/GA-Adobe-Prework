# 🎨✨ Adobe Digital Academy Apprenticeship – Prework Projects

Welcome to my Adobe Prework portfolio! This repository contains all the hands-on projects I completed for the **Adobe Digital Academy Apprenticeship Program**.  
Each module included two assignments:  
- ⭐ A guided **example project**  
- 🚀 My **custom version**, where I applied creativity, styling, layout improvements, and personal flair  

These projects helped me strengthen my foundation in **HTML, CSS, responsive design, JavaScript, and UI/UX design**, while building independent problem-solving skills.
